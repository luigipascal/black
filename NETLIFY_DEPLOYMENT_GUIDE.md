> Deploy your interactive document experience to the web in minutes!

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Methods

### **Method 1: Drag & Drop (Fastest - 2 minutes)**

1. **Prepare the files:**
   - Compress the `web_app/` folder into a ZIP file
   - Make sure it contains: `index.html`, `advanced_ui_index.html`, `enhanced_index.html`, `netlify.toml`

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag your ZIP file to the deployment zone
   - Wait for deployment (usually 30-60 seconds)
   - Your site will be live at: `https://random-name.netlify.app`

### **Method 2: Git Repository (Recommended)**

1. **Initialize Git repository:**
```bash
# In your project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Blackthorn Manor implementation"
```

2. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named "blackthorn-manor"
   - Push your code:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/blackthorn-manor.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - In Netlify: "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Select your `blackthorn-manor` repository
   - Set build settings:
     - **Base directory:** `web_app`
     - **Build command:** (leave empty)
     - **Publish directory:** (leave empty - uses current directory)
   - Click "Deploy site"

## 🎯 Deployment Configuration

Your `netlify.toml` file (already created) handles:
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Redirects for SPA routing

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Setup

### **1. Custom Domain (Optional)**
- In Netlify dashboard: Site settings → Domain management

### **2. Environment Variables**
If you deploy the server later, add these in Netlify:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your server URL
- `REACT_APP_WS_URL`: WebSocket server URL

### **3. Form Handling (Optional)**
For contact forms, enable Netlify Forms in Site settings.

## 📊 Analytics Integration

Add analytics to track usage:

1. **Netlify Analytics** (Built-in):
   - Site settings → Analytics → Enable

2. **Google Analytics** (Free):
   - Add tracking code to `<head>` section of HTML files

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**❌ "File not found" errors:**
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root of your deploy folder
- Check that all file paths are relative (no leading `/`)

**❌ JavaScript not working:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all script files are included in deployment

**❌ Mobile gestures not working:**
- Test on actual mobile device, not just browser dev tools
- Check that touch events are properly registered

**❌ Offline mode not working:**
- Service worker needs HTTPS to function (Netlify provides this)
- Clear browser cache and reload

## 🚀 Advanced Deployment Options

### **Server Integration:**
When ready to add the Node.js server:
1. Deploy server to Heroku/Railway/Render
2. Update API URLs in web app
3. Configure CORS for your Netlify domain

### **Flutter Web Integration:**
To add Flutter web version:
```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter build web
# Copy build/web contents to a new folder in your repository
```
