The retractable ceiling section allowed direct observation of the Pleiades constellation, which William determined had particular influence on The Watchers' manifestation capabilities. His detailed records documented seven-year cycles of increasing and decreasing manifestation activity corresponding to specific alignments of these stars with terrestrial locations around the property, particularly the stone circle and the eastern corner room.

Lady Elizabeth's botanical laboratory developed plant-based containment materials complementing William's mechanical systems. Her research identified specific botanical compounds that disrupted manifestation patterns at the molecular level. The extensive specimen collection included plants gathered from worldwide locations with historically documented dimensional thinning incidents, each cataloged according to effectiveness against specific manifestation stages.

The third floor of the east wing remains something of an architectural mystery, as the original plans appear inconsistent with the external dimensions visible today. Some architectural historians have suggested this discrepancy results from incomplete documentation, while others propose later undocumented modifications may have altered the original layout.

The third floor's discrepancies between internal dimensions and external measurements result from William's implementation of non-Euclidean geometry in certain chambers. These rooms exist partially outside conventional three-dimensional space, creating buffer zones where manifestation energy can safely disperse without coherent formation. The architectural inconsistencies aren't documentation errors, but deliberate design elements creating dimensional interference patterns. William discovered that certain architectural configurations could create spaces partially detached from normal reality—rooms that exist simultaneously in our dimension and adjacent ones. These liminal spaces allowed for controlled observation of The Watchers without risking complete manifestation. The third floor of the east wing contains several such chambers, explaining the inconsistencies between internal measurements and external dimensions. These spaces expand and contract according to dimensional pressure, creating apparent architectural impossibilities that represent actual fluctuations in spatial reality rather than documentation errors.

The small room adjacent to the nursery on the third floor, identified in the original plans only as “FR,” has been the subject of considerable speculation. Unlike other rooms in the manor, no photographs or detailed descriptions of this space exist in the family records made available to researchers.

The room marked 'FR' on architectural plans housed what William called the 'First Responder'—a partially manifested Watcher that remained permanently suspended between dimensions. William discovered this entity could be contained within specialised architectural parameters that prevented both complete manifestation and complete retreat. This permanently liminal being served as a warning system, reacting violently to approaching manifestation attempts by other entities. Its containment required specific geometric configurations maintained through household rituals disguised as routine maintenance.

William's children exhibited varying levels of sensitivity to dimensional phenomena, with his youngest daughter displaying a particularly acute perception of The Watchers. Her bedroom was specially designed with layered protection systems after she began accurately describing entities visible only during active manifestation events. The containment features were disguised as decorative elements to avoid frightening the child while providing necessary protection from entities attempting to establish direct communication."

"The nursery wing incorporated the most elaborate protection systems in the manor, reflecting William's discovery that developing consciousness provided easier access points for dimensional entities. The children reported consistent dreams involving seven distinct figures watching from darkness—each description matching manifestation patterns William documented during controlled observation sessions. These dream communications represented early attempts at direct contact through unformed consciousness, naturally more receptive to non-standard perception.
