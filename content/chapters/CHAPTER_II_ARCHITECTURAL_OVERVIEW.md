William's architectural plans incorporate mathematical concepts that anticipate quantum theory by decades. The proportional relationships between rooms in the east wing create what modern physics would term 'probability interference patterns'—spaces where reality itself becomes less rigidly defined. The relationship between physical dimensions disrupts normal spatial perception in ways subtle enough that most visitors experience only mild discomfort rather than recognising the fundamental wrongness of the space.

The cruciform layout isn't merely aesthetic but functional—creating intersection points where dimensional energies can be channelled and controlled. The central block serves as a neutral buffer zone between the fully conventional west wing and the deliberately destabilised east wing. William discovered that dimensional boundaries require gradual transition rather than abrupt changes, implementing a subtle gradient of increasing dimensional permeability moving from west to east.

The true purpose of the east wing was never residential accommodation but controlled contact with entities William termed 'The Watchers'—beings that existed partially n our dimension and partially beyond conventional reality. The 'guest rooms' were designed for specialised containment of different aspects of these entities, with each space calibrated to specific dimensional frequencies William documented during manifestation events.

The proportions throughout the east wing follow mathematical patterns derived from William's Egyptian discoveries—ratios that create natural resistance to complete manifestation while allowing limited interaction. These proportions would later be independently discovered in quantum physics as wave function relationships governing probability distributions, though William implemented them through intuitive understanding rather than formal theory.

When viewed from above, Blackthorn Manor presents a roughly cruciform layout, with the central block containing the main entrance, great hall, and primary social spaces. The west wing houses the family’s private quarters, while the east wing, the most architecturally distinctive portion, contains what were ostensibly guest accommodations and entertainment spaces.

The 'harmonious dissonance' Barrett identified represents William's deliberate implementation of dimensional interference patterns. These proportional relationships create perceptual discomfort because human consciousness naturally resists awareness of spatial arrangements that violate conventional three-dimensional reality. The discomfort serves as a natural warning system against prolonged exposure to spaces where dimensional boundaries thin.

Of particular note is Sir William’s attention to proportional relationships throughout the structure. Detailed analysis reveals the consistent use of the golden ratio in room dimensions, with subtle variations in the east wing creating what architectural historian James Barrett has termed “harmonious dissonance”—proportions that appear correct at first glance but create subtle perceptual discomfort upon prolonged exposure.

William discovered that certain geometric arrangements naturally repel interdimensional entities while others attract them. The east wing incorporates both—attractive geometries in controlled chambers surrounded by repellent geometries in transition spaces. This arrangement allows for managed contact while preventing uncontrolled manifestation throughout the structure.

The most sophisticated aspect of William's design is the integration of temporal factors—architectural elements that activate only during specific astronomical alignments. Shadows cast by external features create temporary geometric patterns on interior surfaces during these alignments, completing containment configurations only when dimensional boundaries are naturally thin. This dynamic architecture responds to celestial movements without requiring mechanical adjustment.

Structural elements visible to conventional architectural analysis represent only the permanently manifested components of William's design. His complete plans, partially preserved in family archives, indicate additional architectural elements that materialise only under specific conditions. These 'conditional architectures' exist in potential rather than continuous physical form, manifesting when dimensional permeability increases during astronomical alignments.
