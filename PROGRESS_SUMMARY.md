## üé® **Key Features Implemented**

### **Character System**
Each character has distinctive annotation styling:
- **Margaret Blackthorn (MB)**: Elegant blue script (Dancing Script font)
- **James Reed (JR)**: Messy black ballpoint (Kalam font)  
- **Eliza Winston (EW)**: Precise red pen (Architects Daughter font)
- **Simon Wells (SW)**: Hurried pencil (Kalam font)
- **Detective Sharma**: Official green ink (Courier Prime font)
- **Dr. Chambers**: Government black ink (Courier Prime font)

### **Temporal Annotation System**
- **Pre-2000 Annotations**: Fixed in page margins, cannot be moved
- **Post-2000 Annotations**: Draggable post-its, can be positioned anywhere
- **Smart Positioning**: Algorithm generates positions based on character and time period

### **Responsive Design System**
- **Single Page Mode**: Mobile-optimized, one page at a time
- **Book Spread Mode**: Desktop/tablet, two pages side by side
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Maintains document authenticity across devices
- **Performance Limits**: Maximum 8 annotations per page for smooth performance
